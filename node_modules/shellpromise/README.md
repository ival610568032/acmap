# shell promise [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/matthew-andrews/shellpromise.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/matthew-andrews/shellpromise)

Executes some shell, returns a promise.

Internally this library uses [`spawn`](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) so that when `verbose` is set to `true` you can see the live output from the command â€” you don't have to wait for the process to exit to know what has happened (useful for a slow process or a long-running process).

Warning: This micro-library doesn't force you to use any particular Promise implementation by using whatever `Promise` has been defined as globally.  This is so that you may use any ES6 standard Promise compliant library - or, of course, native ES6 Promises.

## Installation

```
npm install --save shellpromise
```

## Usage

```js
var shellpromise = require('shellpromise');

shellpromise("echo 'hello world'")
	.then(function(output) {
		console.log(output); // hello world\n
	});


// For advanced debug pass in `{ verbose: true }` as the second parameter
shellpromise("echo 'hello world'", { verbose: true });
// shellpromise: about to spawn echo hi
// shellpromise: echo output: hi

// To stop stderr from getting into the output redirect with `2>/dev/null`
shellpromise("ehco 'hello world' 2>/dev/null");
```

## Options

- `cwd` to change the current working directory that the command will run on (defaults to `process.cwd()`)
- `env` to set environment variables (defaults to `process.env`)
- `verbose` to see more output
